The line graph in the first tab shows that incidence of pertussis in Australia increases from 2010 to 2011 and decreases in overall trend from 2012 to 2021. The graph for incidence of pertussis in New Zealand shows that cases of pertussis increase from 2010 to 2012 and decreases after 2012 overall. Users can easily make this observation using the trendline function. Next, users can supplement this information using the bar plot in the second tab. Observe incidence of pertussis in non-European countries. Pertussis seemed to be transmitted to the Oceania region starting in Australia in 2010, and to New Zealand in the next few years. In 2010, Australia starts with 158.1 cases per 100,000 population while New Zealand was at 20. In 2011, Australia reaches its peak with 173.5 cases and cases in New Zealand starts to grow as well. New Zealand reaches 133.8 cases per 100,000 population in 2012, becoming the highest country with pertussis cases that year. New Zealand and Australia tops the cases in non-European countries until 2018 when Colombia seems to have an outbreak of pertussis cases. Using these two graphs, users can infer a story about pertussis in the Oceania region over 2010 to 2021."),

An option to choose multiple diseases through check boxes was not included because of missing data for some diseases which may cause a misleading interpretation when comparing two or more type of diseases (e.g. there could be misinterpretation comparing incidence of pertussis and AIDS in Australia because the graph will show data for pertussis from 2010 to 2021 while that for AIDS only for 2010 to 2012).
